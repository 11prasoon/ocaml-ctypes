* Functions passed to C are currently registered as global roots and never
  unregistered.

* Pointers are currently passed to C as immediate values, which means they
  must be word-aligned.  This is mostly fine, but means that we can't bind
  string-processing functions (for example), since

     strchr("ab", 'b')

  returns an address offset by one from the input.  We should support a second
  type of safe, slow heap-allocated pointer for such cases.
