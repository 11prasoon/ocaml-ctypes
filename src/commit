Change the representation of structs; a struct value is now simple a
(fat) pointer.

Entirely rule out passing arrays and unions by value.  Structs with
union or array fields can no longer be passed by value.

Support pointer writes for arrays and unions, and simplify the 

Clear up the semantics of reading/writing/passing/returning various
types.  We now have a clear distinction between reference types (which
correspond to C's aggregate types) and value types (i.e. primitives).
Reading a value type from an address makes a copy, while reading a
reference type creates a (suitably-typed) alias.
